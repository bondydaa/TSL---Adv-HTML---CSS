					What a fun, sexy time for you. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay.

Fried cheese… with club sauce. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM!

					Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball!
